#Active Record Lite

### This is the repository for my code intensive remake of ActiveRecord, the SQL querying program for Rails.

In App Academy, much of the focus of the curriculum was on deeply understanding the tools we use in our projects, so it was commonly encouraged that we rebuild our favorite tools from scratch.

I've rebuilt that Class-to-table relationship, the adding and updating features, the searching features, and associations, including has_many, belongs_to, and has_one_through.
